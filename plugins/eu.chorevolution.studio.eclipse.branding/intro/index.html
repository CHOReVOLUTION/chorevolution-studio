				<h2>The Future Internet Opportunity</h2>
				<p>The Future Internet (FI) represents an age of unprecedented
					opportunities for social, economic, and business growth thanks to
					the global scale connectivity of the virtual as well as of the
					physical world. This indeed opens up a wealth of innovative and
					revolutionary real-life scenarios, as for instance illustrated by
					the smarter cities perspectives where envisioned scenarios
					significantly ease daily human activities and give support for the
					growth of new markets and employment opportunities.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h2>The Future Internet Challenge</h2>
				<p>However, leveraging the FI for the development of innovative
					software applications remain a challenging task even though major
					enablers are readily available by ways of service-oriented and
					cloud computing. It is in particular our vision that enabling the
					choreography of FI services shall play a significant role in the
					provisioning of innovative applications. However, existing
					choreography-based service composition approaches are rather static
					and are poorly suited to the need of the FI that is a highly
					dynamic networking environment, further bringing together highly
					heterogeneous services ranging from Thing- to Business-based
					services that span different security domains. As a result, the
					technology is not mature enough for market take-up.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>The CHOReVOLUTION Solution</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.chorevolution.eu/bin/view/Main/WebHome">CHOReVOLUTION</a> adds the automated synthesis of dynamic and
					secured choreographies to existing choreography technologies. This
					makes these technologies able to support stringent application
					requirements in terms of dynamism and cross-organization security.</p>

				
				<p>To meet its objectives, the CHOReVOLUTION project undertakes
					both research and innovation tasks:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li>Research concentrates on choreography modelling,
						synthesis, adaptation, service bus, security, and cloud</li>
					<li>Innovation focus on industrial validation, development
						support and integration platform, and the establishment of a
						CHOReVOLUTION community and market take-up. CHOReVOLUTION outcomes
						are assessed by experimenting with new applications in the field
						of Intelligent Transportation Systems</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The CHOReVOLUTION software will be published under an open
					source licence and be publicly made available through the OW2
					community.</p>

					<h2>CHOReVOLUTION Objectives</h2>
					<p>In order to make dynamic and secured choreographies in the
						Future Internet via dynamic distributed coordination of services a
						reality, the CHOReVOLUTION project set itself seven objectives:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Choreography modelling notations to support adaptation,
							evolution, and security. CHOReVOLUTION goes one step further
							beyond <a href="http://www.choreos.eu/bin/view/Main/">CHOReOS</a>
							to meet the requireent of industry-grade application. It
							specifically targets novel and more powerful modelling notations
							that, integrated with BPMN2 Choreography Diagrams, will be able
							to represent and assess the adaptation and evolution points of a
							choreography.
						</li>
						<li>Automated and dynamic choreography synthesis.
							CHOReVOLUTION develops the synthesis techniques that are needed
							in order to infer an enhanced collaboration logic that, in
							addition to pure coordination, enables run-time choreography
							evolution in response of possible adaptations, while managing the
							required level of security.</li>
						<li>Middleware for dynamic and secured choreographies.
							CHOReVOLUTION will develop a middleware infrastructure supporting
							end-to-end interoperable and adaptable choreography interactions
							among business services and Things.</li>
						<li>Secured choreographies. CHOReVOLUTION will support
							multiple services involved in a choreography that can belong to
							di fferent security domains governed by diff erent authorities
							and that use di fferent identity attributes in their access
							control polices.</li>
						<li>Validation through industrial use cases. Scientific
							development will validated through two industry-grade use cases,
							Urban Tra ffic Coordination and Smart Mobility and Tourism, both
							in the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).</li>
						<li>Development Support and Integration Platform.
							CHOReVOLUTION uses advanced software engineering technologies to
							support a collaborative development process. Code-level
							interoperability will be achieved by using the platform agnostic
							Java language as programming language for all the CHOReVOLUTION
							tools and middleware.</li>
						<li>CHOReVOLUTION community and market outreach*. The
							objective here is to establish CHOReVOLUTION as an ambitious open
							source project, with its own market visibility and stakeholders,
							supported by a well-established open source community such as
							OW2.</li>
