\n\
CHOReVOLUTION Studio allows choreography designers and service providers to:\n\
A. design a choreography exploiting the CHOReVOLUTION notation (based on BPMN2);\n\
B. define all the details needed for instrumenting the interaction among the services involved in the choreography (e.g. service signatures, protocols, QoS, identity attributes and roles);\n\
C. drive the generation of Binding Components, Security Filters, Adaptors, and Coordination Delegates exploiting the Synthesis Processor and the eVolution Service Bus (VSB) REST APIs.\n\
